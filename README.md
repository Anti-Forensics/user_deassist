This program will allow you to enable or disable UserAssist tracking on Windows 10+.

The target OS will need to be rebooted. I haven't tested other methods.

Usage:  
python .\user_deassist.py --enable  
python .\user_deassist.py --disable

python .\user_deassist.py --enum  
The enum switch will determine what the registry values (that enable/disable UserAssist) are currently set to.
